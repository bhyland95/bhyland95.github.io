# Blake Hyland's Portfoloio

This document is meant to serve as a portfolio of my work and let the world know a little bit more about me. It also serves as a means of getting in touch with myself. 

The document includes the following sections: 
- Home (Meant to introduce the user to the page)
- About (tells the User more about myself)
- Projects (Displays recent and noteworthy projects ive worked on)
- Contact (Helps the user get in touch with me)

The instructions for the project asked me to include a working navigation bar, a structured portfolio, links to my deployed projects, and make it responsive to smaller sizes. 

Here is a link to my portfolio: https://bhyland95.github.io/![Capture
